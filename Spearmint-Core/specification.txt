Spearmint Programming Language

This is the specification for the Spearmint Programming Language (SPM).
This document describes the features a Spearmint interpreter must support. It does not
tell you how to implement it.

Spearmint is a simple scripting language with support for 

Spearmint has 5 built-in datatypes:
	Integer,
	Float,
	Boolean,
	String,
	List,

Spearmint also supports:
	- User Defined Structures


Imports
	The import keyword is used to make code in one module available in another.
	Ex. 
		import "filename.txt"

Variables
	1) Declaration
		Variables must be declared with an initial value before they can be used.
		Ex. 
			var myVar = 6

	2) Reassignment
		Once declared, a variable can have its value reassigned.
		Ex.
			myVar = 2

	3) Accessing
		To access a variable, just type its name.
		Ex. 
			println(myVar)

	4) Dynamic Typing
		Variables are dynamically typed, meaning that they can change types during the execution
		of a program

If Statements
	
Loops
	For Each
	Ex.
		foreach (var item : [1, 2, 3, 4]) {
			println(item)
		}

	While
	Ex.
		while (i < 10) {
			println(i)
			i = i+1
		}
	
Functions
	1) Definition
	Ex.
		fn myFunc(a, b) {
			return a + b
		}

	2) Call
	Ex.
		println(myFunc(2, 3))

Lists
	1) Creation
	Ex.
		var myList = [1, 2] or,
		var myList = list()

	2) Operations
	Ex.
		myList.append(3)
		myList.remove(2)
		myList.find("Cookies")

User Defined Structures
	1) Definition
	Ex.
		
Operators
